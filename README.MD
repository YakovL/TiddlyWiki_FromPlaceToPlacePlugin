📝 This plugin for TiddlyWiki 2.x introduces a "non-cumulative" behavior of links:

* `ctrl + click` on an internal link closes the link source tiddler and opens another one,
* `alt + click` on an external link opens the page in the current tab,
* both modifiers (`ctrl` and `alt`) may be configured.

👀 For more info and a live demo, see https://yakovl.github.io/TiddlyWiki_FromPlaceToPlacePlugin/

🛍️ Available to install via [ExtensionsExplorerPlugin](https://github.com/YakovL/TiddlyWiki_ExtensionsExplorerPlugin),
like many others (to find it, install the central collection and YLExtensionsCollection from it).
